                        <p>The second season begins with Rachel waiting at the gate for Ross so she can declare her love for him. However, she discovers that he is dating Julie, someone he knew from graduate school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross she loves him initially mirror his failed attempts in the first season, but the characters do eventually begin a relationship. Joey gets cast in a fictional version of the soap opera, Days of Our Lives, but his character is killed off after he begins to claim that he writes many of his own lines, bringing him into conflict with the show's writers. Chandler gets back together with Janice, his ex-girlfriend from Season One. Monica begins dating Richard, a recently divorced family friend 21 years her senior, but they eventually break up.<br>Source: <a target="_BLANK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends#Season_2"><u>Wikipedia</u></a></p>
